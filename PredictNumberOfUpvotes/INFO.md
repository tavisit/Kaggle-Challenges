# Predict Number of Upvotes

This repository is the solution to the [Predict number of upvotes](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/enigma-codefest-machine-learning-1/) proposed by [AnalyticsVidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/) and I scored in the top 3% of all participants as I write this document:<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/189039256@N05/50668334856/in/dateposted-public/" title="Predict Number Of Upvotes"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50668334856_ba691b599f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="846" alt="Predict Number Of Upvotes"></a>
