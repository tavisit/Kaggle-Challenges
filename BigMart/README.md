# Kaggle Problems Analysis and Solutions
This repository is my set of solutions to the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) problems. For further information of the implementation, please refer to the INFO.md of each subfolder.

### Nota Bene
This is my first attempt as a machine learning and data analysis practitioner.
If you have a question about the code or the hypotheses I made, do not hesitate to post a comment in the comment section below.
If you also have a suggestion on how this notebook could be improved, please reach out to me.
